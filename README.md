# dbz-fan-page
This DBZ fan page is meant to train me on how to submit forms to a database.

DESCRIPTION:
The purpose of this little Dragon Ball Z website, is for users to be able to choose their favorite character, and then to make comments concerning that character.
We're not focusing on form validation on this particular project. The main purpose to this project is to train on transfering client side inputs, through the server and into a database.
Please feel free to use your own database of choice.

FILE STRUCTURE:
I've had very little time to create this project, and therefore it's not organized as a full MVC model, however: It does contain a view section, while the controller is in the main repo.
If you would like to use this project, just remember that the controller in this case is the file named backend.js. As specified by the title of this file, it contains all the server side programming.

REQUIRED PACKAGES FOR THIS PROJECT:
-express
-body-parser
-ejs

INSTRUCTIONS:
As specified in the previous section, the technologies used for this project, are ejs for the front end, and express for the backend.

DATABASE:
I'm using postgreSQL to run my SQL database. The database is needed for this project in order to store The users and comments they make.

I hope you get a few nostalgic memories. Enjoy :)
